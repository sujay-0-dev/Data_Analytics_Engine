- **Modern Browser APIs**: Performance timing and memory monitoring

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Modern web browser (Chrome 60+, Firefox 55+, Safari 12+, Edge 79+)
- Basic understanding of JavaScript (helpful but not required)
- Text editor or IDE (VS Code recommended)
- Local web server (optional but recommended)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Option 1: Direct File Opening
1. **Clone or Download** the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [your-repo-url]
   cd day2-data-analytics-engine
   ```

2. **Open in Browser**:
   - Simply double-click `index.html`
   - Or right-click → "Open with" → Your preferred browser

### Option 2: Local Web Server (Recommended)
1. **Using Python** (if installed):
   ```bash
   # Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Python 2
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
   ```

2. **Using Node.js** (if installed):
   ```bash
   npx http-server
   ```

3. **Using VS Code**:
   - Install "Live Server" extension
   - Right-click `index.html` → "Open with Live Server"

4. **Open in browser**: Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

## 📖 How to Use

### 1. **Explore the Dashboard**
- View real-time statistics in the top cards
- Observe the automatically generated sample data (500 sales records)

### 2. **Apply Filters**
- **Region Filter**: Select specific geographical regions
- **Product Filter**: Choose from 15+ different products
- **Amount Filter**: Set minimum sale amount threshold
- Click "Apply Filters" to see results
- Use "Reset" to clear all filters

### 3. **Try Array Methods**
Each method card demonstrates different JavaScript capabilities:

- **Transform Data**: See how `map()` enriches data with calculations
- **Filter High Sales**: Watch `filter()` find high-value transactions
- **Calculate Totals**: Observe `reduce()` performing complex aggregations
- **Search Operations**: Test `find()`, `some()`, and `every()` methods
- **Unique Values**: Explore `Set` operations for data deduplication
- **Group Data**: Experience `Map` collections for advanced analytics

### 4. **Analyze Performance**
- Monitor processing times in the performance section
- Observe memory usage and operations per second
- Compare different operation speeds

### 5. **Sort and Group Data**
- Sort by amount or date
- Group by region for summary statistics
- View detailed breakdowns in the data table

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

After exploring this project, you'll understand:

- **Array Methods**: Practical applications of map, filter, reduce, find, some, every
- **Data Structures**: When and how to use Set and Map collections
- **Performance**: How to measure and optimize JavaScript operations

## 🔍 Key Code Examples

### Advanced Filtering
```javascript
const filteredData = salesData
  .filter(sale => sale.region === selectedRegion)
  .filter(sale => sale.amount >= minAmount)
  .filter(sale => sale.product.includes(searchTerm));
```

### Complex Aggregation
```javascript
const regionTotals = data.reduce((totals, sale) => {
  totals[sale.region] = (totals[sale.region] || 0) + sale.amount;
  return totals;
}, {});
```

### Set Operations
```javascript
const uniqueProducts = new Set(data.map(sale => sale.product));
const intersection = new Set([...setA].filter(x => setB.has(x)));
```
